# Decentralized Social Media Platform

## Overview

This project is a decentralized social media platform built on the Stacks blockchain. It combines blockchain technology with a user-friendly interface to create a censorship-resistant, user-owned social network. The platform features user-generated content, token-based incentives, and community governance.

## Features

### Smart Contract (Backend) Features
- User profile data storage and management on the blockchain
- On-chain content reference storage and access control
- Token-based tipping and subscription mechanisms
- Integration with platform governance contract
- Event emission for key actions

### Frontend Features
- User registration and authentication
- User profile creation and management interface
- Content creation, upload, and management
- Feed of user-generated content with infinite scrolling
- Content interaction (like, comment, share)
- Tipping and subscription user interface
- Wallet integration for token management
- Notifications for user interactions and platform events

### Backend API Features
- RESTful API for frontend-blockchain communication
- User authentication and session management
- Content metadata caching for improved performance
- Notification service
- Analytics and reporting endpoints

## Technology Stack

- Smart Contracts: Clarity (Stacks blockchain)
- Frontend: React.js, Redux for state management
- Backend API: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (for caching and non-blockchain data)
- Blockchain Interaction: Stacks.js SDK

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB
- Stacks blockchain development environment

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/decentralized-social-media.git
   cd decentralized-social-media
   
2. Install dependencies:

   # Smart contract dependencies
   cd smart-contracts
   npm install

   # Frontend dependencies
   cd ../frontend
   npm install

   # Backend dependencies
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create `.env` files in the `frontend` and `backend` directories
   - Add necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, database URLs)

4. Start the development servers:

   # Start the backend server
   cd backend
   npm run dev

   # Start the frontend development server
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   
5. Deploy smart contracts:

   cd ../smart-contracts
   npm run deploy
   
## Usage

After setting up the project, you can access the platform through your web browser. Users can:

1. Register an account or log in
2. Create and customize their profile
3. Create, upload, and interact with content
4. Tip content creators and subscribe to their content
5. Participate in platform governance (if implemented)

## Development

### Smart Contracts
- Develop and test smart contracts in the `smart-contracts` directory
- Use the Clarity language and Stacks development tools

### Frontend
- Develop React components in the `frontend/src/components` directory
- Create new pages in the `frontend/src/pages` directory
- Manage application state using Redux

### Backend API
- Develop new API endpoints in the `backend/src/api` directory
- Implement services in the `backend/src/services` directory

## Testing

- Smart Contracts: Run `npm test` in the `smart-contracts` directory
- Frontend: Run `npm test` in the `frontend` directory
- Backend: Run `npm test` in the `backend` directory

## Deployment

1. Deploy smart contracts to the Stacks blockchain (testnet or mainnet)
2. Deploy the backend API to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud)
3. Deploy the frontend to a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel)
